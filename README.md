My Todo App with User Authentication
A simple web application for managing tasks with user authentication. This application allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their tasks. It uses local storage for data storage.

Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up with a username and password or log in with their credentials.
Authentication State: User authentication state is managed using React state.
Protected Routes: Certain parts of the application, such as the todo list, are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
Task Management: Users can create, edit, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
Task Persistence: Tasks are stored in local storage, ensuring they are not lost on page refresh.
Logout: Users can log out of their accounts.
User Interface: The application has an intuitive and clean design for both authentication and the todo list.
Error Handling: User-friendly error messages for incorrect login credentials, registration errors, or failed task updates.
